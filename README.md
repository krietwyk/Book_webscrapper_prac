# Book_webscrapper_prac
A webscraping GUI created as a tutorial for GUI creation, webscraping, text/str analysis and basic URL functions. The GUI scrapes pages from websites with entire books. The user must provide the url for the first page, the book text is extracted from that page and the link to the next page is identified. The text from the next page and link to the subsequent page is likewise read until the end of the book is reached. A simple filter is employed to remove any footers and unwanted spacing.

The GUI was designed as a simple learning excercise and should be not employed to extract text from webpages without appropriate permissions!
